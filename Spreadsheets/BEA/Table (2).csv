"Note. Chained (2017) dollar series are calculated as the product of the chain-type quantity index and the 2017 current-dollar value of the corresponding series, divided by 100. Because the formula for the chain-type quantity indexes uses weights of more than one period, the corresponding chained-dollar estimates are usually not additive."
Chain-type quantity indexes for the series in this table are shown in table NIPA table 7.2.4B.
This table is based on annual and quarterly data published in NIPA table 7.2.6B with underlying detail added.
